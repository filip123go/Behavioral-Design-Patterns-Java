# Behavioral-Design-Patterns-Java
This is a reference project to Behavioral Design Patterns.

Patterns added :

Chain of Responsibility design pattern

 - Returns same instance
 - One constructor method - no args
 - Typically No Interface


Strategy design pattern

 - Guarantees Algorithm adherence
 - IoC
 - Easier implementation


Command design pattern

 - Object per command
 - Class contains the "what"
 - Encapsulates action
 
 
 Interpreter
 
 - Access to properties
 - Function as methods
 - Adding new functionality changes every variant
 
 
 Iterator
 
 - Interface based
 - Algorithm is removed
 - No index
 - Concurrent modification
 
 
 Memento
 
 - State captured
 - Independent state
 - Caretaker/History
 
 
 Observer
 
 - One-to-Many
 - Decoupled
 - Broadcast Communication
 
 
 Template
 
 - same algorithm
 - Class based
 - Compile time
 
 
 Visitor
 
 - Interfaced based
 - Externalized changes
 - Multiple visitors
